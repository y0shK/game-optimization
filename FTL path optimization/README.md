FTL is a roguelike in which the player travels in a spaceship through galaxies.
the gameplay consists of jumping from point to point, but the ship can only travel to close-by points.
I was inspired by the game to create a program which would optimize (or at least detail) the path through which the ship goes through each galaxy.
